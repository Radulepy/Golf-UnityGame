## Time Spent report
- A lot of time (~20h) has been added to the movement of the ball ( force, movement, rotation, etc)
- Designning levels & Backgrounds and making them playable (5 levels, 10h each level)
- Debugging, deleting some unusefull features ( a lot, 10+ hours)

## Problems and Challenges
- A lot of proble,s into the ball control, with the force and the movement + rotation of the ball. Was something pretty hard because 
we couldn't find a tutorial that helped us to finish the movement so it was a combination of our coding skills + unity forums + 2/3 Unity videos 
-Still some problems with displaying the arrow (sometimes goes visible while ball is on the ground) but after a short time (2 seconds) it 
refreshes itself
